# Compliance checklist

- **Parental authority**: Guardians must accept the Terms of Use and confirm parental/guardian rights before pairing.
- **Consent for adults**: Shared devices prompt for explicit, revocable consent with logging.
- **Data minimisation**: Only metadata required for policy decisions is retained; message bodies are never captured.
- **Access & correction**: Privacy centre provides exports (JSON/CSV) and correction request workflow referencing APP 12/13.
- **OAIC contact**: privacy@sentinel.au or GPO Box 5218 Sydney NSW 2001.
- **Breach response**: 30-day assessment window with mandatory OAIC notification for eligible data breaches.
- **Truth in advertising**: Marketing copy avoids absolute claims and includes testing methodology.
