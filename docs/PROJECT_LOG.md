# Project Log (source of truth)

Use this document to coordinate across humans and AI agents. Keep entries short, dated, and link to PRs/commits.

## Conventions
- Always update relevant docs when code changes (README, docs/*.md, infra/*.md, CI config).
- Prefer small entries: What changed, Why, Impact, Next.
- Tag entries with `[code]`, `[docs]`, `[infra]`, `[ci]`, `[plan]` as needed.

## Template
```
### [YYYY-MM-DD] Title [tags]
- What: One-sentence summary.
- Why: Reason for change.
- Impact: User-visible effects or risks.
- Next: Immediate next steps or follow-ups.
- Links: PR/commit/issues.
```

## Active TODOs
- Keep high-signal TODOs here (3-7 items max). Move completed items to the log.

## Log
