2. Verify your email address and complete guardian consent.
3. Create your organisation (your family group).

## Add a child profile

2. Choose **Add child profile**.
3. Enter a display name and select the age band.
4. Assign a policy bundle (recommended: default bundle).

## Enroll an Android device (assisted setup)

You can use a helper Android device (not fully managed) to speed up enrollment for the child device.

2. On first boot, scan the pairing QR code.
3. Install the Sentinel AU Android agent when prompted.

## Review alerts and reports

- **Weekly report**: summaries of activity and top apps.

## Troubleshooting

- **Pairing code expired**: generate a new pairing code in **Pairing**.
- **Device not syncing**: confirm the device is online and Wi-Fi is correct.
- **Missing alerts**: ensure notifications are enabled for your guardian account.

## Safety notes
