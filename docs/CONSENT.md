# Consent workflow

1. Guardian creates an organisation and verifies email + TOTP.
2. Guardian invites other carers; invitations expire after 48 hours.
3. Pairing requires scanning a QR code that encodes a short-lived token.
4. Adults must acknowledge monitoring scope on-device; minors require guardian affirmation.
5. Consent statements stored for 7 years or until device removal.
